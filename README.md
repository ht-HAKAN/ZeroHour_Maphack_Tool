Zero Hour v1.05 Map & Radar Cheat Tool

Cheat tool for Zero Hour v1.05. It patches game.dat offsets in real-time to unlock the map, radar, and stealth detection.

What it does:
- Full Maphack: Removes all fog and shroud.
  
- Radar Always On: Minimap stays active even if you lose power or your CC.

- Stealth Reveal: You can see hidden units.

🎚️How to Use

1- Run the tool as Administrator before opening the game.

2- Launch Zero Hour v1.05.

3- The tool will automatically detect the game process (game.dat) and apply the patches.

4- That's it. Enjoy the game.

⚠️ READ THIS BEFORE USING:

ONLY FOR v1.05: This tool uses specific offsets for the 1.05 patch. It will NOT work on 1.04 or other versions because the memory addresses are different.

GenTool / Online: I tested this online and it works, but GenTool has an anti-cheat. Use it at your own risk in competitive matches. I am not responsible for any bans.

Run as Admin: It needs admin rights to access game.dat memory.
